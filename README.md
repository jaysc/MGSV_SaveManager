## How to use
**If you want to create new, empty saves, turn off Steam Cloud sync for both MGSV: The Phantom Pain and MGSV: Ground Zeroes. Otherwise Steam will download old cloud synced save.**
When first running, the program will create a local save directory in **C:\\MGSV\_saves**. All the save files are stored under **C:\\MGSV\_saves\\USERNAME**.  
* If you only have a single user, the program will select that user automatically.
* If multiple users are found, select your username from the list.
* On the first launch, the currently in use save will be backed up and named **"Original"**. You can use the **Rename** field to name it something else if you wish.
* **Create new saves** by typing a save name to the save name field and clicking **Apply**. The program will then switch to that save automatically and backup your previous save.
* **Switch between saves** by selecting a save from the list (only if more than one save found) and clicking **Apply**.
* **Delete saves** by selecting the save from the list and click **Apply**.
* If you add a save file manually while the program is running, you can click **Save Scan** to update the save lists.
