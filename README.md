# MGSV\_Save\_Switcher
**This script is still under development and bugs might appear. Most of fatal bugs should be dealth with, so the saves should be pretty safe and I try to catch as many bugs as I can before pushing new features out.**  
If you experience bugs and errors, please create an issue with as accurate description of the issue as possible so I can try replicate and fix it.  
This program has been tested on Windows 10 Pro Build 1703.

## Current functionality
* Multiple users
* Multiple saves to switch between
* Save renaming
* Save deletion
* New save creation
* Scan for saves
  
## How to use
When first running, the program will create a local save directory in **C:\\MGSV\_saves**. All the save files are stored under **C:\\MGSV\_saves\\USERNAME**.  
* If you only have a single user, the program will select that user automatically.
* If multiple users are found, select your username from the list.
* On the first launch, the currently in use save will be backed up and named **"Original"**. You can use the **Rename** field to name it something else if you wish.
* **Create new saves** by typing a save name to the save name field and clicking **Apply**. The program will then switch to that save automatically and backup your previous save.
* **Switch between saves** by selecting a save from the list (only if more than one save found) and clicking **Apply**.
* **Delete saves** by selecting the save from the list and click **Apply**.
* If you add a save file manually while the program is running, you can click **Save Scan** to update the save lists.
If you encounter bugs, please create **an issue** with as accurate description as possible of what tried to do and at what point the error/bug happened.
